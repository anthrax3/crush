I'm not an MPlayer, I just Crush a lot.

This is a payload generator for exploiting LZO based multi-media players.
The demonstration payloads target MPlayer2, as that application does not
require more than one vulnerability to gain full remote code execution. 

All other applications based on FFmpeg/Libav are exploitable, but require
multiple vulnerabilities to disclose memory addresses, or to place data
at certain locations in memory. 

Use for testing or demonstration purposes only.
